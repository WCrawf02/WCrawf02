<h3 align="center">CCNP Studies | SANS CyberAcademy Scholar | Attack-Informed Security</h3>

<p align="center">
  Welcome to my Github. I focus on understanding how enterprise networks are designed, how attackers move through them, and how security controld succeed or fail in real-world environments.
<p align="center">  
  My work emphasizes <strong>network security, attack path analysis, and detection-aware offensive security</strong>, built through hands-on labs, simulations, and structured technical documentation.

</p>

## 🩹🔬 What I'm Working On:

**🔹 Enterprise network security labs**
  - Segmentation, routing, ACLs, firewalls, VPNs

**🔹 Attack path & lateral movement analysis**
  - How misconfigurations enable compromise

**🔹 Offensive security fundamentals**
  - Network-driven exploitation and post-compromise movement

**🔹 Linux administration & hardening**
  - Security-focused system configuration

**🔹 Security & network automation** 
  - Python and Ansible for repeatable security workflows

## Certifications 📝
**🔸 Cisco Certified Network Associate**

**🔸 CompTIA Network+**
  
**🔸 CompTIA Security+**
  
**🔸 CompTIA PenTest**

**🔸 (Upcoming: GIAC, GSEC, GCIH via SANS CyberAcademmy)**
